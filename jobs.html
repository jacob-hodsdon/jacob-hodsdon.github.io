<h1> jobs</h1>

I am currently 20 years old and have had a variety of jobs ranging from day care to all the way too construction. Having all of the jobs have given me insight on what direction i plan on heading in life.

<h5> Daycare</h5>
<p> I first started off working for a day care down the street from me around 10-11 years old and it taught me that I have no passion in life for working ith children. but it did however teach me respect for those of us who can handle it. </p>
<h5> Aquarium</h5>
<p> around 2011 I found myself absolutely taken by the idea of marine biology. My next step was applying for a non-profit at a semi-local aquarium for the summer. I was much younger than the rest of the applicants but the leaders there took a chance on me and gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. I was in love with it from the first day but I couldn't see myself doing this as a career. </p>
<h5>Construction</h5>
<p> I have done a variety of construction related jobs including, masonry, road work, and landscaping/tree work, throughout my lifetime having grown up surrounded by it because of our family masonry business. However, even this did not peak my interest having seen the lasting effects it's had on my family both physically, and emotionally.</p>

<p> I have alot of passion about many things but non of which I could do everyday for the rest of my life in order to create income. which is why i believe i need to be an entrepreneur of many trades. </p>
