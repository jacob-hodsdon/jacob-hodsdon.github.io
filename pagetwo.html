Hello everyone, My name is Jacob Hodsdon and I am a junior here at the University of Maine. I grew up here in a small town between Augusta and Auburn. I've attended many schools including l'ecole Fracaise du Maine, Hebron Academy, and Saint Dominic Academy where I graduated in 2016. From there I decided to head south and found myself a freshmen at FSW on the Florida west coast, I took classes for my associates degree in business management and entrepreneurship. After two years I decided to head back home to Maine to attend UMO in order to be closer to home for my last two years of college.
