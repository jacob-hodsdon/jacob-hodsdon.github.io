A couple of things a lot of people do not know about me are that I really despise the cold weather even though I grew up here in maine but I love the winter and everything it has to offer some of my favorite winter activities are

    <ul>
    + snowmobiling
    + skiing
    + ice fishing
    + snow tubing
    + snowbiking
</ul>

Another thing not many people seem to recognize at first is my passion for mechanics. I've been around huge diesel equipment and fast cars all my life so I've grown a passion for both. My first car was a 2002 BMW with nearly 400hp, I then bought a motorcycle because my need for speed was too great. And after a couple close calls and some tickets to match, i found myself rebuilding my grandfathers old dodge cummins which has been by far the largest hit on my bank account, but also my most rewarding vehicle to date.
